![Alt text](images/image.png)


*Data ingestion* is the process of **obtaining** and **importing** data for immediate use or storage in an analytical data store.

*Data processing* is the conversion of raw data to meaningful information through a process. Depending on how data is ingested into your system, you could process each data item as it arrives, or buffer the raw data and process it in groups. Processing data as it arrives is called **streaming**. Buffering and processing the data in groups is called **batch processing**.

In **batch processing**, newly arriving data elements are collected into a group. The whole group is then processed at a future time as a batch. Exactly when each group is processed can be determined in many ways.
