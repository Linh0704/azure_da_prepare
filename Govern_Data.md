Collections also provide a security boundary for your metadata in the data map. Access to collections, data sources, and metadata is set up and maintained based on the collectionâ€™s hierarchy in Microsoft Purview, following a least-privilege model:

- Users have the minimum amount of access they need to do their jobs.
- Users don't have access to sensitive data that they don't need.

### Register & scan data source
